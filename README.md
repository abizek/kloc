# Stopwatch

Stopwatch app with 10ms accuracy and lap support _inspired_ by the Samsung stopwatch.
Made using [Xstate](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate) for maintaining the stopwatch state and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animating the layouts.

> _Xstate is awesome._

> _Framer Motion is neat._

> _Got to give props to React + Typescript (pun unintended)._

## Running the app locally

1. `cd` into the directory root and run `npm i`.
2. Run `npm run dev` and voila! The app should be served on `http://localhost:5173`.

> BTW, I used node v20
